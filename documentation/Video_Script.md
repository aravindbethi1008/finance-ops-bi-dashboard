(5–10 minutes)

1) Intro (20 seconds)
Hi, I’m Aravind Bethi. This is my end-to-end BI project showing SQL + Power BI + data modeling with a reproducible pipeline.

2) Business Problem (45 seconds)
Finance and operations teams need one dashboard to track revenue, transactions, onboarding, and failures, without manual Excel reporting.

3) Data + Pipeline (1 minute)
I generate realistic CSV datasets (customers, accounts, products, transactions) using Python.
Then I load them into a SQLite database and run KPI SQL queries.

4) Data Model (1 minute)
Explain fact_transactions and dimension tables.
Mention star schema idea and why it improves reporting performance and consistency.

5) SQL KPIs (2 minutes)
Show 02_kpi_queries.sql and explain:
- Revenue and transaction KPIs
- Success/failure rates
- MoM growth
- Segment and region breakdown

6) Power BI Dashboard (2–3 minutes)
Show the pages:
- Executive overview KPIs
- Operational deep dive
- Filters (date, segment, region)
Mention how logic matches SQL definitions.

7) Close (20 seconds)
This project reflects how I build compliance-ready and stakeholder-friendly BI reporting with clean modeling and traceable KPI logic.
